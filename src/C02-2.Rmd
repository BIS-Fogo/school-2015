#### Prerequisites

The R **MODIS** package is a valuable set of functions to find, download and 
process level-3 products from the **Mod**erate Resolution **I**maging 
**S**pectroradiometer (MODIS) mounted aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellite 
platforms. There is a comprehensive beginner's guide on 
[Steven Mosher's Blog](https://stevemosher.wordpress.com/modis-tutorial/) that 
describes how to successfully setup the **MODIS** package including all relevant 
prerequisites and which you might want to have a look at. Prerequisites include

* the [MODIS Reprojection Tool](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool) 
to automatically process the acquired MODIS data and
* [OSGeo4W](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) featuring all required GDAL 
libraries.

Once installed, the **MODIS** package will automatically check if all required 
software packages are installed on your local machine and make suggestions in 
case any of the two is missing. 
  
<br>  

#### Installing the **MODIS** package
Since it is not (yet) an official CRAN package, **MODIS** is currently hosted on 
[R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1252). The latest package 
version 0.10-33 can easily be installed using

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
## package url
modis_url <- "http://download.r-forge.r-project.org/src/contrib/MODIS_0.10-33.tar.gz"

## install package
install.packages(modis_url, repos = NULL)
```
  
<br>  

#### Checking the **MODIS** installation  
Before anything else, make sure all additionally required packages (the 
so-called 'dependencies') are installed via 

```{r deps}
MODIS:::checkDeps()
```

If this operation fails, you will automatically be prompted to install whatever 
packages are missing in order to solve this issue. Next, you should tell 
**MODIS** where to store downloaded (`localArcPath`) and processed 
(`outDirPath`) MODIS imagery. For the moment, let us save all downloaded data in 
a subfolder of our current working directory named 'data' and all processed data 
in a subfolder named 'data/processed'. 

```{r modis_opts, eval = FALSE}
## load required package without startup messages
library(MODIS)

## set output folders (messages disabled)
MODISoptions(localArcPath = "data/", 
             outDirPath = "data/processed/", 
             quiet = TRUE)
```

There is also a function to check whether all of the above-mentioned external 
software tools are installed and their system paths are set properly (Windows 
sends its regards...). 

```{r tools}
MODIS:::checkTools()
```

If no further warnings occurred, then you are now ready to start. Well, 
almost...

#### Sinusoidal tile grid
Before launching a download, be advised that high-order MODIS products are 
commonly subdivided into tiles based on the so-called 
[Sinusoidal tile grid](http://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html) (see 
image below). Make sure to identify the coordinates (in **h**orizontal and 
**v**ertical direction) of the tile you would like to process before commencing 
with the actual data download - it will save you a lot of time!   

![sinusoidal_tile_grid](http://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/MODIS_sinusoidal_grid1.gif)

<br> 

#### Data download
Right now, the package offers support for MODIS land products (distributed via 
[LPDAAC](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/) and [LAADS](https://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/) 
only. For a full list of available datasets, type `getProduct()`. For the 
moment, let us download some 1-km resolution 16-day Terra-MODIS NDVI images 
(product 'MOD13A2') from August 2015 over Cape Verde. You may possibly have 
noticed alreaedy from the image above that Cape Verde is included in tile 
h15v07. Here is a list of arguments you will need in the following. For more 
detailed information, have a look at `?getHdf`.

* `product`: MODIS product to be downloaded
* `begin`: start date ("YYYY-MM-DD")
* `end`: end date ("YYYY-MM-DD")
* `tileH`: **h**orizontal coordinate of the desired MODIS tile
* `tileV`: **v**ertical coordinate of the desired MODIS tile

Alright, let us give it a try. Remember that an entire MODIS tile will be 
downloaded, so this might take a few seconds.

```{r download, message = FALSE}
## download data
getHdf(product = "MOD13A2", 
       begin = "2015-08-01", end = "2015-08-14", 
       tileH = 15, tileV = 7)
```

If everything worked fine, there should now be a file named
'MODIS/MOD13A2.005/MOD13A2.A2015225.h16v07.005.2015243211134.hdf' in the 'data' 
subfolder of your working directory.

<br>

#### (Download and) process data
Unfortunatelly, MODIS data commonly come in .hdf format that most users are 
rather unfamiliar with. Luckily, **MODIS** provides functionality to 
automatically extract ordinary GeoTiff (.tif) images from the .hdf 
container file. The referring function is called `runGdal` and works very 
similar to the previous `getHdf` command. A quick look at `?runGdal` reveals 
that this function supports even more specifiable arguments. Amongst those are

* `SDSstring`: the desired scientific datasets (SDS) to extract; see e.g. 
[the MOD13A2 product description](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod13a2) 
(tab 'Layers') for a detailed list of SDS that come with the product
* `outProj`: the desired output projection
* `job`: a job name which will be passed on to the subfolder in 'processed'

We will set `SDSstring = "10000000000` since, for the moment, we are only 
interested in the raw NDVI values. Furthermore, we will specify ordinary 
'Latlong' (EPSG:4326) as output projection. Note that if you are willing to 
download and extract MODIS data in one step, you may simply use `runGdal` 
instead of `getHdf`. Alright, let's try this.

```{r extract, message = FALSE}
runGdal(product = "MOD13A2", 
        begin = "2015-08-01", end = "2015-08-14", 
        tileH = 15, tileV = 7, 
        SDSstring = "10000000000", 
        outProj = "4326", 
        job = "ndvi_1km_16day",
        quiet = TRUE)
```

<br>

#### Wrap-up

If everything worked out fine, there should now be a file named 
'ndvi_1km_16day/MOD13A2.A2015225.1_km_16_days_NDVI.tif' in the 'data/processed' 
subfolder. You may want to have a look at it using

```{r visualize, message = FALSE}
## import raster file
rst <- raster("data/processed/ndvi_1km_16day/MOD13A2.A2015225.1_km_16_days_NDVI.tif")

## visualize ndvi image (multiplied by scale factor)
plot(rst * 0.0001, xlim = c(-25.5, -22.5), ylim = c(14.5, 17.5), 
     zlim = c(-0.1, 1), colNA = "lightblue", 
     xlab = "Longitude", ylab = "Latitude")

```
